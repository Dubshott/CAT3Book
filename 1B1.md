"I hate my roomate. I hate my life!" you write on the caption of your private Instagram post. University of Dubs has a pretty decent computer science program so that wasn't too bad. However, you low-rolled in the roomate selection process. Your roomate is weird. Whenever you're doing work on your computer he just stares at your screen. He's just weird in general. All you can think about is going back home.

*I can't wait until winter break. I just want one month away from this hell.*

You put your phone away as you prepare to sleep. Suddenly, you hear the sound of a blanket moving back and forth in a rhythmic manner coming from your roomate's side of the room. You look over and try to make out what he's doing in the dark room. It looks like he's driving stick on his bed, whipping through the gears as if he's going 0-60 in just a few seconds.

*Aww what the hell? I have an 8 a.m. math lecture tomorrow morning I have to wake up for.*

<hr>

It's three minutes until 8 a.m. as you sit down in a seat at your math lecture. As you take out your notebook and pencil and girl walks by and randomly says hi to you. 

"Hi!" you respond. *Do I know her?* you think. The whole lecture you couldn't focus as you kept sneaking glances at her from across the lecture hall. *Why did this girl say hi to me?*

<hr>

You're in your English class now. The professor is blabbering on about some boring topic and you zone out. As you regain full consciousness you realized that the girl that greeted you in math is also in this class.

*Maybe she's noticed that we share these classes together! Does she like me?*

You squeal and giggle in excitement quietly. Maybe a bit too loud because the guy next to you looked at you weird.

*Should I talk to her after the class ends? What should I say?*

You can't think of what to talk to her about so you decide to just go back to your dorm. However, the brief interaction with a member of the opposite sex made your day. It probably made your whole first year of college. You couldn't stop thinking about it for the whole day.

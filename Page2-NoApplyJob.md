# Don't Apply to Code Gladiators

You decided to not apply to Code Gladiators. Great! This means you have much more time on your hands now. This means that you can spend more time working on your applications and your grades. However, you also have the chance to play more games and save your sanity! 

If you decide to become more studious, you will lose happiness and sanity, but you will become smarter and get more prepared for college! Afterall, a good college is what matters most, right? 

`Happiness -2`
`Sanity -5`
`Smartness +5`


If you decide to play more video games, you will become much happier! You will become slightly more addicted as video games are where all your friends connect. 

`Happiness +3` 
`Addiction +2`
`Sociability +2`

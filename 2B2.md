# You decide to continue playing video games

You tell yourself, _Whatever. They have no idea what they are talking about. They just don't believe in me. I'm going to be the best League of Legends player ever!_

<hr>

A few months pass, and you have been grinding the ranks in League of Legends. 

You had a lot of challenges along the way. In the beginning, it wasn't too bad because you only had increased wrist pain, skin blisters, and sleep problems. However, as you went months into playing, you started developing symptoms of obesity and numbness in the hands. It was uncomfortable for you, but you still rode through the problems. After all, you needed to become a professional e-sports player!

However, good things also came out of this journey. As you progressed through the ranks, you met a girl by the name of Kathy in one of your League matches and you became close friends. After about 2 weeks of friendship, decided to confess your feelings.  

"Hey Kathy, I have to tell you something" you squeaked. 

"What is R04?" she asks, using your username instead of your real name. 

You decided to use some "rizz techniques" you learned from Jason the Weenie when you were watching videos on Youtube. 

"First, let's turn our cameras on, okay?" you babbled as you turned on your camera.

"Alright!" She replied, joyfully. 

"Lit. I need to show you something really cool."

As soon as you said that, you played a popular song and started using Jason the Weenie's rizz techniques to try and make Kathy fall into your charms.

After your performance, you looked back at Kathy in the discord call. She was dumbfounded and clearly uncomfortable about what you just did. However, you didn't let it deter you. You decided to immediately pop the question. 

"Kathy. I LOVE YOU! PLEASE BECOME MY DISCORD KITTEN!!" you proposed. 

"Really, Anthony. It's only been two weeks" she stated, with a hint of disgust.

"Uh.. Uh.. Uh.. but I still like you?" you spluttered. 

"JUST KIDDING! I LOVE YOU TOO! I will happily become your Discord Kitten!" she squealed.

A few months later...

"Let's go! I finally made it to Challenger, the highest rank in League!" You beamed. 

"Good job pookie bear! I will give you an 'uwu' now! UWU!!" your discord kitten congratulates. 

"Thank you, my naughty discord kitten. Huhuhuhu." 

"Since you got to the highest rank, please buy me Discord Nitro oniii-chan! Please give me your credit card, uwu!"

"Huhuhu. You're welcome my little whiskers. You always make me so happy. I'm so glad you are in my life!" 

"YAY! Thank you senpai! Meow! Meow!" 

"Now I'm going to apply for my favorite e-sports team and hopefully I get on the team! Cheer me on my favorite kitten." 

"Woohoo! Good luck master!" 

"I love you so much kitten."

"I love you too senpai! I'll stay with you forever!" 

<hr>

3 Weeks later...

"YESSAH! I got into my favorite e-sports team, Fnatic!" you exclaim. 

_This is what I have been planning for my entire life. I have finally achieved my goal._ 

You finally got into the e-sports team you have always dreamed of joining. Now, you gain lots of fame and money through your e-sports tournaments and your daily 12 hour League of Legends streams on Twitch. You still have the growing problem of obesity and hand problems, but you decide to push through and continue your gaming life. 

You feel like your life is great because you are making so much money, have so many fans, and have your loving discord kitten always at your side.

# END.

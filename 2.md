 You# Don't Apply to Code Gladiators

"I'll look into it" you say, clearly unenthusiastic about the proposal. 

"Great. I'll send you the link if you would like to join." Mr. Maximus replies.  

After looking at your course load and the other extracurriculars you were in, you decided to not apply to Code Gladiators. It didn't even look that appealing to begin with.

"Code Gladiators would have just taken up all my time" you tell yourself.

A few days later, your friends call you. 

"Hey Anthony, wanna get on League of Legends with us?" your friend, Monkey, asks. 

You reply, "For sure! We just doing casual again?" 

"No way! We are all going to try grinding to get to diamond rank. If we get there, we are going to get crazy amounts of respect!" Monkey exclaims. 

"Dang bro, we are only in bronze. That's going to take a lot of time and work to get better!"

"Don't worry bro. It will be crazy fun and then we will have something to drive us through high school. It's a great idea, I promise."

"I mean we are already in 11th grade bro and we both have 4 APs. Is this really the smartest move?" 

"Man, we are literally the smartest in the class. These classes will be a piece of cake! Come on bro, just get on!" 

While contemplating your decision, you take the two sides into consideration. You could try to become more studious and get prepared for college, but you will have a really boring high school life. On the other hand,  you could play some more video games and reach a high rank with my friends, which would make you incredibely happy and get a better connection with your friends. 

"So what's it going to be, Anthony?" Monkey questions.

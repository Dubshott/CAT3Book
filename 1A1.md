*Code Gladiators is such a scam. I'm working my ass off and for what? 14 dollars an hour?*

You imagine the possibilities of creating your own coding tutoring company and how much money you could probably make from it.

A few months later, you have over 30 students who take weekly classes. You hired 10 tutors to teach the students so that you don't have to the teaching yourself. By charging the students 30 dollars per session and paying the young high school tutors $15 an hour, you are making $450 dollars a week as passive income. Business has become successful and growing.

It's now been 10 years since you started your coding class company, Code Cyborgs.

"Hey Gilbert, I'm gonna head out now," you tell your personal assistant, "I'll see you tomorrow morning."

After parking your car in the garage, you grab a snack and head to your desk. You turn on the computer and open Discord and message your old high school friend, Bill, who now lives across the world. You've been keeping in touch with him by playing video games together every other day. 

"I'm home now, get on Overwatch" you message him. A few seconds later you see the three little dots telling you he's typing.

"Aight, I'm getting on now."

You and Bill play Overwatch 3 for an hour, which is enough for about three competitive games. You get off the game and start preparing dinner and after eating and resting for a bit you will head to the gym for a nighttime workout.

Your life has been pretty stress free but you have also been well occupied by balancing your work and personal life as well as getting good amounts of sleep and exercise. With your successful coding tutoring company, you have been financially stable and will be able to retire in a few years. It seems like the journey from now and on will be smooth-sailing.

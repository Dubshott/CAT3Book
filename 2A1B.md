# Decide to do something else

You look back at your APUSH exam and understood that you made a huge mistake. You wasted hours of your day playing a game that you don't even remember instead of studying for something that could have affected your future. 

You start planning out some things that you could be doing instead of playing video games. Two main options came to your mind. 

_I remember rejecting that Code Ninjas offer. Maybe I should consider joining that so I have some more extracurriculars._

_I could also just start studying even more, so that I can try avoiding playing video games._

Community College sucks. You commute to classes half the week. It's hard to make friends since you are barely at school.

*At least I was accepted into a school,* you think, comparing yourself to a high school classmate who wasn't accepted into any school. However, you were technically in the same position as your classmate: stuck in community college.

Motivated to one-up your classmate, you grind your coursework and are able to get enough credits to apply for transfer.

The hard work paid off.

You quickly open Discord and join the voice channel with your friends who are playing Teamfight Tactics.

"Who just joined?"

"I think it's Anthony."

"Guys, guess what?"

"What?"

"You have to guess you goofball!" you squeal, barely able to keep in your excitement. 

"Uhhh...you got a new keyboard? I don't know?"

"I got into UCSD!" you scream in a high pitch, your voice on the verge of cracking.

"Yoooo!!! GG!"

"GG"

"GG!"

You take off your headphones and skip in circles around your room with your arms in the air.

"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

UC San Diego was a dream come true. You actually knew people here and there were so many opportunities to make new friends. Now that you're in your dream school you could relax a bit more but you still worked hard in your classes. In your free time you still played video games as a means of socializing with some out of state friends but you also go to the gym and get insanely ripped.

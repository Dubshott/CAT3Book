# You Decide to Stop Playing Video Games

_I can stop video games whenever I want. I'm literally not addicted._

That was anything but the truth. You found it incredibly hard to get out of your video game addiction. You spent many days trying to stop yourself from playing video games. However, you still failed multiple times. You experienced compulsions, cravings, and urges to play video games. It was almost like going through withdrawal from drugs. 

_Maybe I'll just play a game. It couldn't hurt right?_

_NO WAY. If I play a game now then I'll lose my streak._

_Eh. It wasn't even a long streak. Maybe I'll just play a short game. Just to get rid of these urges._

_YOU CAN'T! Otherwise we'll get trapped again!_

_I need to satisfy these urges. I'll just play a quick game. Just to cure my addiction for a few days._

You constantly suffered from internal conflicts as you competed with yourself to stop playing video games. Along with this, you felt many symptoms of withdrawals and became increasingly irritable and started having mood swings.

Your family members and friends started becoming distant as they wanted to avoid your irritations. Your family didn't know why you became so prickly and started to show more coldness towards you and avoided you to ensure they didn't fall in your tantrums. In addition, your friends started to evade you because of your attitude and because they didn't want to involve themselves in your personal struggle. 

_Shit. I'm screwed. I'll never recover._

45 days later...

Your temptations started to decrease much more and you could feel yourself starting to get adjusted to the no video game lifestyle. However, you still constantly had urges to play video games.

Your willpower became much stronger and you forced yourself to stop playing, no matter how much you wanted to relapse. 

_I need to play video games now._

*You slap yourself.* 

"OW! WHAT WAS THAT FOR!" You ask yourself. 

"Shut up you idiot! That's what you get for thinking about video games!" You answer. 

*You slap yourself repeatedly.*

"OW! OW! OW! OW!"

1 month later...

Your dopamine levels drastically decreased and started to rewire itself back to its original settings. Your cravings almost became non-existent. Your mood became much better and you started connecting back with your family and friends again.

In addition, you spent a lot more time focusing on what you liked. You began working out much more, started to play the guitar, and improved your confidence.

You finally finished your strenous internal trial to finally get over your video game addiction.

<hr> 

It's been a couple months now and you are in the peak of your life. Life is great now as you don't succumb to the powers of addiction anymore and you actually focus on things you like.

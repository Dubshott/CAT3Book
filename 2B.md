# Play more Video Games

"Alright, fine! I'm getting on!" You proclaim. 

"That's the spirit! We are going to start roasting them way too hard!" Yasaswi said. 

<hr>

Through the months that passed, you played even more video games. You grinded hard to become better at your champion and you spent many hours practicing with your team to get better. Slowly, your rank started getting higher and higher.

9 months later...

"LET'S GO!!!!" you hollered. "We finally got to diamond!!" 

"WOOOHOOO!!! WE DID IT!" Yasaswi cheered. 

Along with Yasaswi, you made many more friends through your League of Legends games and Discord communities. They all joined your adventure to get to the diamond rank. They all cheered along with you. 

"LET's GO!"

"WE'RE JUST BETTER!!!" 

"YESSAHHH!!!"

"Alright. Let's stop playing tonight or else we'll start losing," you announced. 

"Skull emoji times 7" your new friend, Yagoot, responded. 

"L-M-A-O! L-M-A-O! L-M-A-O!" your other friend, Electronic, sang.

Another friend, Harrison, asked, "You guys wanna go out tonight and celebrate?" 

You all responded at the same time: "OF COURSE!"

Throughout the next few months, the amount of video games you played increased tenfold. You felt that you had some potential for league of legends and focused even more time into video games, avoiding your schoolwork and other responsibilities. You knew you had that special talent and you wanted to continue feeding it. You even won a local League of Legends tournament and won a cool prize!

One day, your friends came to your house to surprise you. 

"Hey what are you guys doing here" You said perplexed. 

"We came since it was your birthday bro! But why are you still playing League of Legends?" Yagoot asked. 

"Oh lol. Because I am too goated at this game!" 

"Bro, you might need to cut down on the video games. You're kind of playing too much"

"Nah, I'm all good!" you rebut. "Whatever, let's go do something now."

You and your friends go out to do something, but the thought of you playing too much video games became stuck in the back of your mind. 

<hr> 

Once you finished hanging out with your friends, you decided to have a moment of contemplation because too many people have been telling you that you have been playing too many video games. 

_It's not like I'm even playing that much. Plus I'm trying to become a professional e-sports player for League of Legends~

_I am playing for more than 6 hours a day though. Maybe I should cut it back._

_No way! I need to start playing MORE so that I can get a pro e-sports job!_

_But maybe I'm addicted to video games and I can't stop myself._

_I DON'T KNOW!_

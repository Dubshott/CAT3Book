# "Just One Game"

"LETS GO! I knew you were smart enough to see the toll it was taking on you!"

"Yeah, you're right."

You ended up playing five games that night. Not one.

While you do lose control from time to time, you generally do a pretty good job at moderating your video game time. You still get pretty good grades, albeit not as good as before when you were studying twice as much. When college admissions rolls around, you feel you have a pretty good resume. You spend most of your time in 12th grade writing college essays while playing league at the same time. After all the decisions came out, you ended up being accepted to your target school, University of Dubs. You're happy with it. 

At university, you continue your life more or less the same. Still a studious student, but also dedicating time to socializing with both new and old friends. During the day, you run around campus with your lecture pals. At night, you're on call with Monkey and all of your other high school friends. You've even started dating someone at UD! You feel the happiest you've been in a long time.

# "Just One Game"

"That's what I'm talking about!" Monkey exclaimed. 

You smile and load up League of Legends.

"Ay I might not be as good as before tho" you warn Monkey. 

"All good bro. You finally got of that horrible study grind! Time to actually live your life."

"Sure, sure, sure. Just get on already."

You looked through your characters again and picked the champion that you like to play the most. You waited to load into the casual game like before and created some small talk with monkey.

Once you got into the game, you felt a surge of adrenaline as you get excited from playing your favorite game. You and Monkey started using your old strategies to try and take control of the field and try winning. The game took only 20 minutes out of the normal 40 minutes because of how good you and Monkey were playing. 

"Bro we are playing crazy good! Let's get on competitive mode bro!" Monkey begged. 

You remember how Monkey wanted to just play a normal game and you consider just declining him. But, you couldn't stop yourself from agreeing because of the rush you get from the game. 

"Uhhhh. Alright, fine! Start the queue," you hesitated. 

"Now that's what I'm talking about!" Monkey burst.

You look at the clock, expecting the time to be only 12:00 A.M. However, upon glancing at it, you read 4:27 A.M. Your eyes opened wide in disbelief and you clickly closed out the game.

"Hey where did you go bro?" Monkey questioned. 

"BRO! IT'S LITERALLY 4 AM!" you shrieked. 

"And? That's my normal bedtime."

"HUH?! How do you sleep that late?!" 

"I just got used to it, lol." 

"Nah bro, I'm out!" 

You quickly got into bed and tried to squeeze out as much sleep as you could get. 

<hr> 

Throughout the next few days, you continued to try and study for your APUSH exam, but it became much harder. Before, your break included going on Instagram or reading some Webtoons, but that wasn't enough anymore. You were starved of video games and wanted to get back in. 

"It's only like 30 minutes. I'll have plenty of time to study after. Plus, I'm already doing well in APUSH," you justified. 

You decided to hop on League of Legends again. You played one casual match and did really well again. 

 _Let's go! That was too easy. I think I still have some extra time since that game finished quickly. I'll just get on one comp, so I can inch my up the ranks_, You reasoned.
 
 You played through a 40 minute game of competitive, fueled through frustration as your teammates constantly let you down through that game.

 _I can't end on a loss. If I do, I will be too pissed off to study. I need to play one more so I can win and feel happy,_ you concluded. 
 
 You decide to hop back on and try to win again. This cycle continued for a couple hours until you won a couple games and looked back at the time. 
 
 _SHIT!! I'VE BEEN ON FOR 3 HOURS! I NEED TO GET BACK ON MY APUSH GRIND_ 
 
 You get back on your APUSH studying, but you feel distracted throughout your study session. 
 
 <hr> 
 
On Friday, you finish your test and go back home, feeling slightly dejected. You felt like you didn't do as well as you hoped on the APUSH exam. However, you weren't too worried since your APUSH grade was already really high. 
 
As soon as you get home, you get a call from Monkey. 

"Ay bro! APUSH test done. Now get on League so that we can celebrate finishing it. Plus you need to carry us,"  Monkey encouraged. 

What will you reply?

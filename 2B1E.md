"Hey Anthony! How was class today?" she asked you. 

"Oh.. Uh.. Good. Hello! Who.. How.. When are you? Anthony, my name is " you spluttered. 

"Ok, great! I'll see you later" she giggled. 

"Nice" you answered as you walked away. 

You thought about that moment for the rest of the day. 

_Who is this girl and why did she come up to me?_

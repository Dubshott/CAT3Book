# "Still studying"

"Fine. Nothing I can do to convince you. See ya."

You feel a little bad, but Monkey just doesn't get it. This is the dedication necessary for you to be where you want to be. 

You don't slow down the intensity. In fact, you speed up. You realize Monkey's invitation was an invitation back to the old you before high school. The old you who played video games all day, didn't do anything of value, and performed mediorcly in all of their classes. You understand that you need to run as far away from that you as possible.

When college admissions rolls around, you're already ready. While people are still coming up with their essay topics, you've already finished all of them, including every supplemental. While people struggle to maintain the balance between grades and social life, you have no issue. After all, all you're focusing on is grades. And extracurriculars, of course. When decisions come out, you're ecstatic, as you're admitted to one of the most prestigious univerisities in the world, the University of Dubshotts. All that effort, all that studying, it was all worth it.

Once you're at university, however, you start to struggle. It's been so long since you've hung out with friends that you struggle to make new ones. You end up just continuing what you've been doing in high school, studying. But even that gets boring after a while. You start to play video games again, but only single player games as you're intimidated at the thought of playing with other people. You really did run far away from that old you.

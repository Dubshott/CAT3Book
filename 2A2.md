# "Still studying"

"Hell nah. I'm studying. Don't talk contact me anymore." You assert. 

"Huh. What?" Monkey asked, clearly perplexed about what you just said. 

"You heard me. You guys have such a bad habit about playing games. I'm leaving this friend group so I won't be corrupted. Goodbye."

"What in the... Well screw you! You'll never get friends acting like this!" Monkey said as he slammed the phone down. 

_Whatever. He was a loser anyways. I'll just focus on my own thing and get into a good college._ You say to motivate yourself. 

_Now it's time for the grind. It's my time now._

A full year later, you finally finished 11th grade and started writing your college applications. You had a plethora of activites to write down and you knew you were going to get into the college you wanted. The most prestigious college ever, University of Dubshotticals. 

"Alright mom. I'm submitting my application" you tell your mother. There was no hint of fear or worry in your statement. 

"I believe in you, Anthony. Go make us proud!" your mother tells you.

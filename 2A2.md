# "Still studying"

"Hell nah. I'm studying. Don't talk contact me anymore." You assert. 

"Huh. What?" Monkey asked, clearly perplexed about what you just said. 

"You heard me. You guys have such a bad habit about playing games. I'm leaving this friend group so I won't be corrupted. Goodbye."

"What in the... Well screw you! You'll never get friends acting like this!" Monkey said as he slammed the phone down. 

_Whatever. He was a loser anyways. I'll just focus on my own thing and get into a good college._ You say to motivate yourself. 

_Now it's time for the grind. It's my time now._

A full year later, you finally finished 11th grade and started writing your college applications. You had a plethora of activites to write down and you knew you were going to get into the college you wanted. The most prestigious college ever, University of Dubshotticals. 

"Alright mom. I'm submitting my application. lol." you tell your mother. There was no hint of fear or worry in your statement. 

"I believe in you, Anthony. Go make us proud!" your mother tells you. 

"I already know I'm mega smart. I don't need your belief. lol." 

"Oh. Okay then. I'll leave you to it." 

"Yeah. Leave me to it. lol." 

You didn't even need any essay help or anything because of the skills you honed from taking advanced english classes like APEL and APLIT. Everything came easy to you and you had no problems getting your application ready.

You looked towards the best school in the entire nation, University of IncredoDubshotticalsofAmerica and got everything before the early decision came about. You quickly submitted your application and immediately stopped even thinking about college applications. Instead, you looked towards the future. 

_Since I'm done with applications, I might as well get started with my college work. If I can finish a bunch of classes right now, then I will be able to graduate University of IncredoDubshotticalsofAmerica in 1 year. Then I can get my Masters in Computer Science in 2 months. Then, I can become the CEO of Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. That would be too easy. lol._

February came. The release of early decisions. As you came to school you overheard a couple students from your grade talk about their application to University of IncredoDubshotticalsofAmerica. 

"Yo bro, what was your decision?" The first kid asked. 

"Oh shoot. It came out? Frick. Let me check." The second kid replied. 

"I checked last night. I hate this idiotic school. Nobody is even going to get accepted. I heard only 1% of people got admitted to the school."

"Damn it. Ugh. I didn't get in."

"Yeah, don't worry about it bro. I don't think anybody would have gotten into that school. If they did, they must have been a crazy loser."

"Yeah, for sure. There's no way a normal person or a person with a social life is getting in this school." 

You think to yourself, _Ho, ho, ho. Only a plebian would think so stupidly. Of course, my masterful intellect is no match for anyone else in this school. Let me check if I got in. lol._

You whip out your phone and press the email app. You go into Updates tab and see the unread email notification with the subject being, "Click to open your decision". You slowly pressed through all the links because afterall, you already know you got in. 

You finally passed through all the security checks and you pressed the big green button. "Congratulations, Anthony." Yup. Expected. 

You walk over to the guys that were talking about their decisions and shoved your phone right in there faces. 

"Huhuhuh. I got in suckers" You tell them haughtily. 

"What the... well congratulations bro" they reply, respectfully. 

"Yeah. I knew I would get in. After all, I am much smarter than you losers." 

"What did this guy just say?" The random guys ask themselves. 

"Well screw off buddies. You can't stay in my personal bubble." 

After that statement, you feel a strong rush of pain in the right side of your face. When you realize what's happening, you are on the ground being beaten by the two guys.

"Ouch guys! That hurts real bad!" You try to tell them, hopefully getting them to stop beating you up.

"Ugh! I knew you losers couldn't take my masculine energy."

After saying that, the two guys started kicking you even harder.

After you come home from school, you run quickly upstairs, trying to avoid your parents. You go straight up to your bathroom and admire yourself. 

"Wow. I look so tough. I must have been too much for those kids to handle huhuhu."

After admiring yourself in the mirror, you start applying your makeup from your Pat McGrath LABS Mothership Totale III makeup set and apply it on all your scratches to try and make it look like you weren't beat up. 

After doing so, you decided to call up your one friend from school, a girl that you tutored.

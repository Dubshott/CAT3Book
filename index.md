# Introduction

In this choose your adventure you will have multiple choices, and they will all change your life. You will playing as Anthony Vo, a high school student at Dub Northey High School. You have a loving family with a younger brother and a younger sister. You have a decent size group of friends that have the same hobbies as you. Currently, your hobbies are coding, studying, working, playing league of legends, and getting to know your teachers better. 

Your main goals are finish high school with all A's, and get into your favorite college, Dubshotticalness College. However, you through these years, you need to manage Anthony's decisions. 

**Beware!** The options in this story are meant to _**look**_ a certain way. It might seem like the option is definitely leaning towards one way, but don't be fooled! Sometimes the decision that looks wrong is actually the better option. Therefore, just make the choice that seems more logical to you. After all life works in mysterious ways!

Note: You will see a lot of sentences like this:

_I think I am so cool._

_No you aren't._

_Yes I am._

These italicized words mean that Anthony is thinking something. It's supposed to be an internal monologue. Sometimes, it looks like theres a whole conversation. That is because Anthony has to constantly converse with himself to try and make the right decision. (Also for comedic effect)

This book uses multiple types of pictures. The first type is pictures of Anthony and the other type is Anime pictures. We wanted to include both of these so that it would be more engaging and comedic and see the true emotions of a certain situation. 
 
This is a picture of you: (now it will be easier to imagine)

"Hey, Anthony!" calls out your computer science teacher. 

You answer, "Hi Mr. Maximus. What can I do for you?"

"I have an opportunity for you. These people called "Code Gladiators" reached out to me and they wanted to know if any of my students wanted to have an unpaid trial period. I was wondering if you would like to join."

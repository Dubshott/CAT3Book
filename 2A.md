# Started Studying More

You decided to start spending more time studying and getting good grades in high school. Your grades have significantly improved and you are constantly maintaining As! This is looking good for your college admissions. However, it has taken a toll on your mental health. You've gotten less and less sleep as you've increased your studying intensity. Additionally, you've started to spend a lot less time hanging out with friends like Yasaswi.

It's just another night of your new lifestyle. Thursday 11:30 p.m. Studying for an APUSH test. Then, something different happens. You see a discord notification at the bottom right of your screen, from Yasaswi.

_Huh_, you think to yourself. _It's been so long, I forgot I even had notifications on._

You open up the notification.

"Hey, I know it's been a while, but wanna play a game of league again? Don't worry, just a normal game, no ranked. It's just been a long time and I miss playing with you."

You reply quickly: "Sorry, studying rn"

"Huh? For what test?"

"APUSH, test is Friday"

"Uh, yeah. NEXT Friday. Are you really studying for a test at this time when it's happening in over a week?"

This stops you for a second. Have you gone too far? Is it possible to go too far studying? Surely not! Right? You're grades have never been better! And even if you're losing friends and your mental health is getting worse, it's all worth it once you're going to a great college! ...Right?

"Come on dude," Yasaswi continues, "Even you can tell this is too much. You need to take a break from studying or you're gonna lose your mind!"

_Ugh, is he right?_ You think to yourself. _Is a break all I need?_

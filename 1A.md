You turn on your microphone.

"Hi Super Code Sensei Uma. Sorry, I was distracted on my computer. I know that this is my fault and that I should put all my focus into teaching this class."

"That is right Anthony, you shouldn't be distracted while teaching this class. I will leave you to finish this class but we will talk later about this."

"Thank you Super Code Sensei Uma. It won't happen again."

After finishing the class, you join your boss' zoom meeting room. She goes over the policies for being a Code Sensei, emphasizing that you shouldn't be distracted while teaching a class.

"Anthony, I know you have been a helpful teacher for the past few months, but I will have to demote you to a Code Sensei Assistant until you regain my trust. I don't know if I can trust you to teach a class by yourself yet."

"I understand Super Code Sensei Uma. This won't happen again and I will prove to you that I can learn from my mistakes and become more focused."

"Thank you for understanding Anthony. You may go now."

This experience has led you to question your work ethic. You wonder why you have been putting a small amount of effort into this job even though it could be helpful in advancing you to a greater career in the future.

_But this job is so boring, and I'm barely getting paid!_ 

And now you are just a teaching assistant. You can only imagine the humiliation you will receive from your coworkers.

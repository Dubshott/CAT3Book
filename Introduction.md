You are currently in Dub Northey High School. This is a competitive high school school in San Diego where most of the students in the same year are also incredibly smart. 

Your main goal right now is to get into a good college by getting good grades, getting recommendations from teachers, and find more extracurriculars. However, you want to make sure you maintain your sanity by meeting up with friends, texting on Discord, and playing League of Legends. 

You are in the 11th grade, the most hectic time of your life. You are looking for opportunities to develop your resume, so that colleges will like you more. 

Your teacher, Mr. Maximus, just sent a new message in Slack, your class's messaging platform. You decided to click the message and see what it was about. You read that there was a "internship" opportunity in a new company called Code Gladiators in which you would teach students how to code, but you would get no volunteer hours and no money. You would start getting an hourly wage a few months into the program.

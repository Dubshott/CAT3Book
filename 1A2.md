You've been working at Code Gladiators for the past four years. It's gotten you into the college University of Dubs where you are studying computer science. It's not one of the best programs for computer science, but it is still pretty decent. 

Every single weak you groan and complain each time you have to teach a student for Code Gladiators. You've increased the amount of students you teach each week. As a result, you were given an increase in salary from $14 dollars an hour to $20 dollars an hour. It's not the best but it is decent enough to allow you to have spending money for League of Legends skins.

Your daily life has been pretty shitty.

Eat.

Go to lectures.

Teach for Code Gladiators.

Play League.

Study a bit and do some homework.

Eat.

Sleep.

Repeat.

<hr>

You are consumed by this repetitive and unexciting lifestyle as you see yourself start to increase the amount of time you spend on video games. From an hour a day to almost six hours spent playing League to grind your competitive ranking. 

"Bro, get some sleep."

"Take a shower, you stink!"

"Go touch some grass"

Initially, the words hurt. However, you began to see League of Legends as a safe space, where you could hide from the negativity of outside world. You see that League of Legends helps you become a more positive person even when the chat can be very negative.

*It's just text. Text can't hurt me. But the words of the people in the outside world will do me harm.*

In reality, the increasing time spent on the video games was a sign of addiction and video game disorder. As you become more and more consumed by the game your grades fell harshly and your social skills declined. It seemed like the video game world became your natural habitat and the real world became foreign.

"H-Hello? Hello?" You pretend like your internet had just cut off. "Can you hear me?"

"Anthony, yes, I can hear you."

"Sorry Super Code Sensei Uma. I had some internet issues that were causing my Zoom to stop working."

"Were you able to see the email I sent you?"

"Yes, I saw it."

"I thought you had internet issues?" Uma asked interrogatively. 

You quickly come up with an excuse: "You see, my phone was connected to cellular service. I think the wifi in my house was cut off for a second though."

"Oh, that makes sense Anthony. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. Please continue with the rest of your class."

Your boss leaves the meeting and you check the time. Class is over so you tell Jimmy that he is free to leave now.

"Goodbye Jimmy. I'll see you next week. Sorry for the internet issues," you say as you quickly exit out of the meeting.

You hop back into your discord call with your friends and back into the game.

"I'm back guys. There's no way my boss actually came into my zoom meeting and destroyed me for being off task."

"What did you do?" asked Ethan Vo, your friend.

"I just told her I had internet issues. Works everytime."

For the next two years, you are able to continue as a Code Sensei at Code Gladiators. Even though you are being paid minimum wage, you continue with the job knowing that it could be used as an important extracurricular activity for your college admissions.

After college admission results come out, you are dissapointed to see that you weren't able to get into many colleges, especially UC San Diego, which you and your friends wanted to go to. Your only choices are University of Dubs or go to community college and possibly transfer into UC San Diego's Computer Science program, which is ranked 3rd in the world. University of Dubs' Computer Science program is ranked 41st in the world.

Do you want to attend:

or

### [ Community College ](/1B2.md)

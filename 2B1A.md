# Epilogue

One day during class, a random girl came up to you.

"Hey Anthony! How was class today?" she asked you. 

"Oh.. Uh.. Good. Hello! Who.. How.. When are you? Anthony, my name is " you spluttered. 

"Ok, great! I'll see you later" she giggled. 

"Nice" you answered as you walked away. 

You thought about that moment for the rest of the day. 

_Who is this girl and why did she come up to me?_ 

_Maybe she likes me or something. Hee Hee Hee!"_

Throughout the next few days you constantly kept thinking about this beautiful girl and why she came up to you of all people. your first thought was just to forget about it, but then you remembered your resolution. 

"I need to become more confident" you tell yourself valiantly. 

"Tomorrow, I will talk to her and get to know her like a real man." \

<hr>

The next day approaches...

You sat back down in your computer science class, ready to learn. You made your way to your unassigned assigned seat and sat down, waiting for the class to start. You decide to go on your phone and waste away some time.

You were tempted to go on Twitter and watch League of Legends clips and fall back into your video game life, but you didn't allow yourself to. Instead, you decided to watch some basketball clips and watch your favorite player, Jeremy Lin. 

_Man Jeremy Lin is crazy good. I wish I was as good as him. I'm going to train like him. I'll try copying everything he does except for his shooting form. His shooting form is super weird because it looks like he's bending his back and maybe not his confidence because he's too confident and also I think his dribbling_

"Hey Anthony!" the familiar girl interrupted. 

As your internal monologue broke, you looked up to see the beautiful face of the girl you met the day before. 

"Uh! I like Jeremy Lin!" you blurt. 

_What the hell did I just say. Im folding!_ 

"Uhm, cool?" The girl replied, hesitantly. 

You realize now is the perfect time to start developing your confidence.

"Just kidding. It's nice to meet you. What's your name?" 

"Haha. My name is Kathy! It's nice to formally meet you too!" 

<hr>

A few months go by. You and Kathy have been spending much more time together, meeting up whenever you can and getting lunch and dinner together. You feel extremely comfortable around her and see her as something more than a friend. However, you definitely won't be telling her that! It's too embarassing!

As you think about more things to do with her, you the idea of video games pops back in your head. 

_Hell no. I'm not getting back into that addiction._ You think. 

_But it would be super fun to play with her and teach her how to play._

After pondering the thought for a while, you came up with a conclusion: 

_Fine. I'll ask her to play video games with me. However, this time, I'm going to properly manage my time while playing and set strict limits. That way, I can't get into back into that addiction._

You decide to ask her right there and then. You hop on Discord and send her a quick message.

"Let's go!" You shout out loud. 

"What happened, Anthony?!" Your mother squealed, running up the stairs. 

"Oh nothing. Sorry for shouting!" You yell back. 

<hr> 

Over the next few months, you and Kathy started hanging out even more than usual, thanks to the use of the online setting through video games. You become even more sociable as you make new friends through the games you play and get to become more outgoing towards Kathy. Throughout this, you maintain your strict schedule for video games to ensure you don't succumb to the addiction again. 

After months of being friends with Kathy, you came up with an idea.

_I need to ask her out now. It's been so long since we've become friends and I've connected to her on a different level. I'm going to ask her out tomorrow._

While waiting for the next day, you decided to come up with some plans to ask her out. You decided the most romantic thing would be to go to a nice view and set up a romantic picnic.

After school, you went to find Kathy to invite her. 

"Hey Kathy!" You smiled. 

"Hey Anthony!" Kathy replied. 

"I kind of set up something for us. You wanna come?" 

"Ok sure. Where is it?"

"It's a suprise lol. Now come and follow me!" 

.
.

After making it to the spot, you and Kathy continued talking about normal school life, video games, and other things going on in life. Finally, you decided to pop the question. 

"Hey Kathy." You say. 

"What's up?" Kathy replies. 

"I'm feeling romantical tonight baby girl." 

"What the...?" 

[Insert Anthony Rizz Face]

"We've been best friends for so many months so I have to come out and say it." 

She seemed to know what you were heading towards and started blushing. 

"Be my girlfriend, baby girl" you state, with rizz. 

She looks around sheepishly and quietly whispers, "finally..."

After going through so many hard times in your life, you really have reached the perfect outcome! You developed your confidence to such a high level that you could break through the wall of embarassment and ask out the love of your life. You also balanced your normal life and your online life by properly managing your the time you play video games. 

You sit in your chair, staring at the open scenery filled with the sun, clouds, and a beautiful blue sky. You feel the warmth of the sun spreading across your face and your hands. You find it hard to keep your eyes open as your head is filled with drowsiness and thoughts. You sit there, thinking about everything that happened in your life from the bad all the way to the good. You tell yourself one last thing before you fall asleep: 

_Why am I such a dubshot?_

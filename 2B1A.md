One day during class, a random girl came up to you.

"Hey Anthony! How was class today?" she asked you. 

"Oh.. Uh.. Good. Hello! Who.. How.. When are you? Anthony, my name is " you spluttered. 

"Ok, great! I'll see you later" she giggled. 

"Nice" you answered as you walked away. 

You thought about that moment for the rest of the day. 

_Who is this girl and why did she come up to me?_ 

_Maybe she likes me or something. Hee Hee Hee!"_

Throughout the next few days you constantly kept thinking about this beautiful girl and why she came up to you of all people. your first thought was just to forget about it, but then you remembered your resolution. 

"I need to become more confident" you tell yourself valiantly. 

"Tomorrow, I will talk to her and get to know her like a real man." \

The next day approaches...

You sat back down in your computer science class, ready to learn. You made your way to your unassigned assigned seat and sat down, waiting for the class to start. You decide to go on your phone and waste away some time.

You were tempted to go on Twitter and watch League of Legends clips and fall back into your video game life, but you didn't allow yourself to. Instead, you decided to watch some basketball clips and watch your favorite player, Jeremy Lin. 

_Man Jeremy Lin is crazy good. I wish I was as good as him. I'm going to train like him. I'll try copying everything he does except for his shooting form. His shooting form is super weird because it looks like he's bending his back and maybe not his confidence because he's too confident and also I think his dribbling-" 

"Hey Anthony!" the familiar girl interrupted. 

As your internal monologue broke, you looked up to see the beautiful face of the girl you met the day before. 

"Uh! I like Jeremy Lin!" you blurt. 

_What the hell did I just say. Im folding!_ 

"Uhm, cool?" The girl replied, hesitantly. 

You realize now is the perfect time to start developing your confidence.

"Just kidding. It's nice to meet you. What's your name?" 

"Haha. My name is Kathy! It's nice to formally meet you too!"

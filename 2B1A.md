"Hey Anthony! How was class today?" she asked you. 

"Oh.. Uh.. Good. Hello! Who.. How.. When are you? Anthony, my name is " you spluttered. 

"Ok, great! I'll see you later" she giggled. 

"Nice" you answered as you walked away. 

You thought about that moment for the rest of the day. 

_Who is this girl and why did she come up to me?_ 

_Maybe she likes me or something. Hee Hee Hee!"_

Throughout the next few days you constantly kept thinking about this beautiful girl and why she came up to you of all people. your first thought was just to forget about it, but then you remembered your resolution. 

"I need to become more confident" you tell yourself valiantly. 

"Tomorrow, I will talk to her and get to know her like a real man."
